# Characters #

The player has a party of up to 5 characters of varying class.  Each character has equipment and abilities that can be used during turn-based combat.

## Classes ##

Classes determine the type of weapons and the types of equipment a character may equip.  This is a very rough list of classes and general attributes:

* Warrior
  * Sword/Hammer/Mace/Flail/Axe
  * heavy armor
  * physical attack
  * close range
* Assassin
  * Throwing knives/axes
  * leather armor
  * physical attack
  * mid range
* Archer
  * Longbow/Crossbow
  * leather armor
  * physical attack
  * long range
* Monk
  * Gloves/knuckles
  * cloth armor
  * magical attack
  * close range
* Druid
  * Sling
  * leather armor
  * magic attack
  * mid range
* Wizard
  * Staff
  * cloth armor
  * magic attack
  * long range

## Stats ##

Characters have various stats.  Core stats and their starting values are determined by class, and modifiable by equipment. Stats include:

* Vitality      - determines max HP
* Strength      - determines base physical attack power
* Endurance     - determines base physical defense
* Agility       - determines parry/dodge/physical atk hit %
* Initiative    - determines turn order conflicts
* Intelligence  - Determines base magical atk
* Wisdom        - Determines base magical defense
* Focus         - Determines % interrupt of charging abilities

## Equipment ##

All characters have slots for equipment - equipment grants passive stat modifiers.

### Weapons ####

Weapons determine attack type and range:

* Sword/Hammer/Mace/Gloves - 1 range, melee, 1 or 2 handed
* Lance/Spear - 2 range, melee, 2-handed
* Staff - 5 range, 2 handed
* Bow/Crossbow - 7, ranged, line-of-sight, 2 handed
* knives/stars/slings/wand - 3, ranged, line-of-sight, 1-handed

### Equipment Slots ###

Equipment goes in slots, what types of things can be equipped is determined by the class.

Weapon slots (determines attack range):

* Left Hand
* Right Hand

Armor slots (cloth/leather/heavy): 

* Head
* Arms
* Chest
* Back
* Legs
* Feet

Accessory slots (equipable by any class):

* Belt
* Ring 1
* Ring 2
* Neck

## Abilities (Runes) ##

Runes of power (or something) grant special abilities to characters.  Only N number may be available at a time during combat, but an unlimited number can be bound to a specific character.  This is similar to choosing equipment, in that you asign a "rune" to an available ability slot.  It is different from equipment in that, once bound to a specific character, a rune cannot be transferred to another character.

Runes are only discoverable by exploration in the world, and/or completing challenges and quests.

## Items ##

Items are consumables and usable by any class.  They can be discovered or crafted.  There probably won't be item slots, and instead just a shared item pool for party members.
