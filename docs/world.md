# World #

> TODO: elaborate... find old docs...

* Explorable world
* zones controlled by factions
* PvP encounters determine faction ownership
* fast travel down unobstructed roads from map (between cities usually)
* non-faction-owned zones require manual traversal, could trigger PvP encounters (opt-in)
* uncharted areas are proceedurally generated, can invite other real-player party members to join for co-op play
* death sends you back to nearest city (penalties?)
