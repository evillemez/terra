# Voronoi Diagram #

An implementation of a Voronoi Diagram using Fortune's algorithm.

> *NIH*: The Voronoi diagram implementation contained in this directory is based on the implementation by Raymond Hill here: https://github.com/gorhill/Javascript-Voronoi.  The only reason I didn't just use that implementation is because I wanted to understand it better, so I used it as a guide to implementing it myself.
